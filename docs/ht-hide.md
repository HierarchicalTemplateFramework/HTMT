# `ht-hide`
The `ht-hide` attribute in the HTMT (HyperText Markup Templating) system allows developers to dynamically hide HTML 
elements based on the evaluation of JSONPath expressions. This feature is crucial for creating responsive and 
interactive web interfaces where the visibility of elements depends on specific conditions in the data model.

## Syntax
The `ht-hide` attribute can be added to any HTML element. The value of this attribute is a JSONPath expression that 
evaluates to a boolean. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the element is hidden; otherwise, it remains visible.
```html
<div ht-hide="expression"></div>
```
- `expression`: A JSONPath expression that determines whether the element should be hidden.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
Hiding an element if a user is not logged in: 
```html
<div ht-hide="$.user.isLoggedIn">
    This content is only visible if the user is not logged in.
</div>
```

### Complex Conditions
Using a more complex condition, such as hiding an element if a user's account is expired: 
```html
<div ht-hide="$.user.accountStatus == 'expired'">
    Your account is active.
</div>
```

## Best Practices

- **Clarity and Maintainability**: Write clear and straightforward JSONPath expressions to ensure that the logic behind visibility is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Data Binding**: Ensure that any data used in `ht-hide` expressions is correctly bound and updated in your data model to reflect changes in real-time.
- **Fallback Content**: Consider providing fallback content or alternative views for hidden elements, especially in applications where user interaction can change visibility states frequently.

## Compatibility
`ht-hide` is implemented through JavaScript and relies on the evaluation of JSONPath expressions. It should be 
compatible with all modern browsers that support ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and later. Make sure that your implementation 
degrades gracefully in environments where JavaScript is disabled.
